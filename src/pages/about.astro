      <p>
        Sproutful began with Scotty — a young man with non-verbal autism — and the daily challenge of keeping everyone
        on the same page. As his friend and support worker, David saw how scattered notes, missing details, and
        inconsistent updates made it hard for both support workers and families to feel informed.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Scotty’s mum, Rosa, often felt disconnected from what was happening when they were apart. Paper notes weren’t
        enough — and there were no tools built for the realities of support work.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After completing a software development diploma, David decided to fix the problem instead of working around it.
        He teamed up with his best friend of 15 years, Timmey, and together they built the first version of Sproutful —
        a simple way to keep care teams organized and families always in the loop.

      <p>What started as a solution for one family is now helping many more.</p>
